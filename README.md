The aim of this project is to analyze the mobility data made available by Apple.

That data is available for download for the following URL:
https://covid19.apple.com/mobility

It currently uses dplyr to work with some of the tabular data. Eventually, it will
also include the use of ggplot2 to visualize the dataset 

### Change Log

* 2020-09-23: Added second script to use dplyr to tally up the count of 
cities and counties in a given state that have data from the different 
transportation types
* 2021-09-22: Create Github repository and push commits for the first time.
* 2021-09-20: Initialize git repository for the project in 2021
* 2021-08-31: The data file It was originally downloaded for analysis.
* 2021-09-17: A new version of the data file was downloaded, and I also worked to refactor the code to be more general and to allow for any state to be subset from the larger file.
